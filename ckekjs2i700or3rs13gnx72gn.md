## Hello world!

When people start learning anything new in programming, the first code they write is usually called... well 'hello world'. If you're like me, you've always wondered the origin of this phrase in programming. 


So that started somewhere around 1970. When the C programming language was being developed at Bell Labs. The very first publication of it was a simple C program that output the string 'hello, world' and a newline character. 

```
main( ) {
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
``` 

For me personally, programming is one of the most fascinating things I've ever learned. I learned programming from an old book I had found in my high school library, and ever since then, I have gone on and to write at least a hundred hello world applications in different programming languages and platforms. Needless to say I have also written much complex applications. Connect with me on Github. 
This also happens to be my very first attempt at blogging. So yes! It's a new hello blog. Cheers to learning!
